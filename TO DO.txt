Decisions to make:
☑ Select variables to use
☑ Design BN variations
☐ Decide how to subdivide countries
☑ Decide how to store data

Responsibilities to Assign:
A- Download variables whe don't have yet
F- Encode data structure
A- Scale variables
M- Aggregate data
F- Calculate STE
 - Automate BN derivation (use elimination?)
 - Construct BN1 (naive) for each aggregation
   - Version 1:  5 variables
   - Version 2: 10 variables
 - Construct BN2 (layered) for each aggregation
   - Version 1:  5 variables
   - Version 2: 10 variables
 - Modify BN2 to deal with time slices (Education' now influenced by GDP)
   - Version 1:  5 variables
   - Version 2: 10 variables
 - Compute accuracies
 - Measure performance (time, complexity, etc)   
 - Presentation
 - Report
